Description: Node.js library for building user interfaces
 node-react is a library for building JavaScript user interfaces.
 .
 Some features of React:
  * Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design
    simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently
    update and render just the right components when your data changes.
    Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand,
    and easier to debug.
  * Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state,
    then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in
    JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your
    app and keep state out of the DOM.
  * Learn Once, Write Anywhere: it doesn't make assumptions about the rest of
    the technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without
    rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and
    power mobile apps using React Native.
 .
 This package installs the ReactJS library for Node.js.

Description: node-react library to serve as the entry point to the DOM
 node-react is a library for building JavaScript user interfaces.
 .
 This package provides a library to serve as the entry point to the DOM and
 server renderers for node-react. It is intended to be paired with the generic
 node-react package.

Description: JavaScript library to test if a value is a React.js element
 node-react is a library for building JavaScript user interfaces.
 .
 This package allows one to test arbitrary values and see if they're a
 particular React element type.

Description: React.js library to integrate Fast Refresh into bundlers
 node-react is a library for building JavaScript user interfaces.
 .
 This package implements the wiring necessary to integrate Fast Refresh into
 bundlers. Fast Refresh is a feature that lets you edit React components in
 a running application without losing their state. It is similar to an old
 feature known as "hot reloading", but Fast Refresh is more reliable and
 officially supported by React.
 .
 This package is primarily aimed at developers of bundler plugins.

Package: node-react-shallow-renderer

Provides: ${nodeReactShallowRenderer:Provides}
Replaces: node-react (<< 18.2.0~)
Description: Shallow renderer for testing ReactJS modules
 When writing unit tests for React, shallow rendering can be helpful.
 Shallow rendering permits one to render a component "one level deep" and
 assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about
 the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered.
 This does not require a DOM.

Description: Experimental React renderer to be used to render React components to pure JavaScript objects
 node-react is a library for building JavaScript user interfaces.
 .
 This package provides an experimental React renderer that can be used to
 render React components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the
 DOM or a native mobile environment.
 .
 Essentially, this package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the "DOM tree"
 rendered by a React DOM or React Native component without using a browser or
 node-jsdom.

Description: JavaScript library for cooperative scheduling in a browser environment
 node-react is a library for building JavaScript user interfaces.
 .
 This package provides a library for cooperative scheduling in a browser
 environment. It is currently used internally by node-react.
